Hi, I am Qingyuan Ma. I am looking for potential summer research opportunities for 2024, hopefully continuing research beyond the summer period.
With nearly a year of experience in the lab, primarily focusing on research in the multimodal field and gaining knowledge in related areas like computer vision, I've come to enjoy the challenges and innovation inherent in academic inquiry.

This time in the research environment has provided me with valuable insights into research methodologies. I hold a strong interest in the multimodal field, motivating me to seek further knowledge. I aspire to not only continue my current research trajectory but also to broaden my horizons by delving into various fields.
