# Research Experience:

**Visual and Linguistic Concepts in VLMs**  (June 2023 - Present)
- Conducting an independent research on Vision-Language Understanding based on the CVPRâ€™22 paper â€˜Winoground: Probing Vision and Language Models for Visio-Linguistic Compositionalityâ€™.
- Using typographic attack to understand how the model perceives text infomation in images.
- Reproduced code from the ICLRâ€™23 paper â€˜When and why vision-language models behave like bags-of-words, and what to do about it?â€™ and tested its performance on Winoground dataset.
- Used generative model DALL-E 2â€™s decoder to present representations in latent space.
- Explored Classifier-Free Guidance, forward and backward diffusion algorithm.

**VQA for Visual Aid Device**  (Feb 2023 - Present)
- Building a fore-end Web that allows volunteers to participate in the assistance process, using JavaScript.
- Designed a visual aid device in the shape of sunglasses for visually impaired individuals.
- Completed basic functions (image caption, VQA from model â€˜Prismerâ€™) on hardware device ESP32 with crew members.

**Model Pruning**  (Jan 2023 - Sep 2023)
- Now under review as a conference paper at ICLR
- Collaborated with a crew to prune multi-modal model BLIP using Intrinsic dimension (ID).
- Created visual representations such as diagrams and charts to illustrate key results in the paper.
- Reproduced and modified code from the NIPSâ€™19 paper â€˜Intrinsic dimension of data representations in deep neural networksâ€™ for its application in BLIP.
- Learned to run tasks on large-scale models in ID computation, retrieval and VQA experiments.
- Adopted Gradient Accumulation algorithm to improve GPU computing efficiency.
  
**Adversarial Attack**  (Oct 2022 - Dec 2022)
- Reproduced the code in the ACLâ€™18 paper â€˜Attacking Visual Language Grounding with Adversarial Examplesâ€™ and generated adversarial examples (invisible noise) based on Gradient Method.
- Acquired proficiency in PyTorch, built virtual environment and ran code on GPU.
